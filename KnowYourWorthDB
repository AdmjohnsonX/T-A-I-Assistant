        {
          "tip": "Trust your gut feelings. If something feels off about a person or situation, listen to that inner voice. Your intuition is your best protector in dating."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Always meet in public places for the first few dates. Choose busy, well-lit locations where other people are around."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Tell a friend or family member where you're going and who you're meeting. Share your location and check in with them during or after the date."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Keep your personal information private initially. Don't share your home address, workplace details, or financial information early on."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Pay attention when details don't match up or stories change. Inconsistent stories could indicate dishonesty or hiding something important."

    "Manipulation": {
      "tips": [
        {
          "tip": "Watch out for love bombing - excessive affection and attention early on can be a manipulation tactic to quickly create emotional dependency."
        },
        {
          "tip": "If they make you question your own reality or memory, that's gaslighting. Trust your perception of events and don't let anyone make you doubt yourself."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Be wary of someone who isolates you from friends and family. Healthy relationships encourage maintaining your support network."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Notice if they're constantly playing the victim or blaming others for their problems. This can be a sign of manipulation and lack of accountability."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Watch for guilt-tripping or emotional blackmail. Statements like 'If you loved me, you would...' are red flags for manipulation."

    "Boundaries": {
      "tips": [
        {
          "tip": "It's okay to say no at any time, for any reason. You don't owe anyone an explanation for your boundaries."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Notice how they react when you set a boundary. A healthy partner will respect your limits without pressure or guilt."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Don't feel pressured to move faster than you're comfortable with, whether physically, emotionally, or in commitment level."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Your boundaries should be respected the first time you state them. You shouldn't have to repeatedly enforce the same boundary."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Watch out for someone who tests your boundaries repeatedly. This shows a lack of respect for your autonomy and comfort."

    "Communication": {
      "tips": [
        {
          "tip": "Healthy communication includes listening, not just talking. Notice if they genuinely hear you or just wait for their turn to speak."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Be cautious of someone who gives you the silent treatment as punishment. This is a form of emotional manipulation."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Watch for defensiveness when you bring up concerns. A healthy partner should be able to discuss issues calmly."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Notice if they use 'you always' or 'you never' statements. These absolutes often signal unhealthy communication patterns."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Pay attention to how they talk about their exes. Constant negativity about all past partners might be a warning sign."

    "Online Safety": {
      "tips": [
        {
          "tip": "Do a reverse image search on their profile photos to verify they're real. Catfishing is more common than you think."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Be suspicious if someone refuses to video chat or always has excuses not to meet in person after several weeks."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Never send money or gift cards to someone you've only met online, no matter how convincing their story is."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Use the dating app's messaging system initially rather than giving out your phone number right away."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Be cautious of profiles that seem too good to be true - professional photos, vague job descriptions, or overly flattering messages early on."

    "Physical Safety": {
      "tips": [
        {

        },
        {
          "tip": "Keep your drink with you at all times and watch it being made. Never accept a drink from someone you just met that you didn't see prepared."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Trust your instincts if you feel uncomfortable. It's okay to end a date early or leave a situation that doesn't feel right."

        {
          "tip": "Charge your phone fully before dates and consider having a safety app or emergency contact system set up."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Avoid secluded locations, especially for first dates. Parks at night, empty beaches, or someone's home are risky choices early on."

    },
    "Respect": {
      "tips": [
        {
          "tip": "Notice how they treat service workers, their family, and strangers. This reveals their true character more than how they treat you initially."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Watch for signs they're not over their ex - constantly talking about them, comparing you to them, or still in regular contact."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Be wary of someone who puts you on a pedestal early on. Idealization can quickly turn to devaluation."
        },

          "tip": "Pay attention to how they handle disagreements. Name-calling, yelling, or insults are never acceptable."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Notice if they respect your time. Chronic lateness, last-minute cancellations, or breadcrumbing show a lack of respect."

    },
    "Self-Worth": {
      "tips": [
        {
          "tip": "Remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Don't settle for less because you're afraid of being alone."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Don't ignore red flags hoping they'll change. People show you who they are - believe them the first time."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Your worth isn't determined by whether someone chooses you. The right person will appreciate you without needing convincing."
        },
        {
          "tip": "It's better to be single than in a relationship that makes you feel anxious, sad, or constantly questioning yourself."
        },
        {
          "tip": "Don't lose yourself trying to be what you think someone wants. The right person will love you for who you authentically are."
