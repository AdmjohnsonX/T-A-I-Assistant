                "tip": "You don’t need to earn basic respect. The right connection won’t make you prove your worth or shrink your needs."
            },
            {
                "tip": "Feeling calm and secure around him is a green flag. Constant anxiety is information, not something to push through."

                "tip": "Your intuition notices things before your heart explains them. If something feels off, you’re allowed to listen."

            {
                "tip": "A man who likes you will make it clear. Mixed signals are often a clear signal of low intention."

                "tip": "You’re allowed to change your mind. Choosing yourself later is still choosing yourself."

            },
            {
                "tip": "You don’t owe access to someone just because they show interest. Attraction doesn’t cancel discernment."

            {
                "tip": "A healthy connection won’t punish you for expressing feelings. Communication should feel safe, not risky."

            },
            {
                "tip": "If someone only shows effort when you pull away, that’s not interest growing, it’s control losing access."
            },
            {
                "tip": "You don’t need to convince someone to value you. Genuine interest doesn’t require persuasion or pressure."

            },
            {
                "tip": "Don’t ignore early discomfort just to keep momentum. Early signs often become bigger patterns later."

            },
            {
                "tip": "Being chosen daily matters more than being pursued intensely once. Watch who stays consistent."
            },
            {
                "tip": "You’re not difficult for wanting reassurance. The right person won’t make you feel needy for asking."

            },
            {
                "tip": "Your worth isn’t measured by attention received. It’s reflected in how you allow yourself to be treated."
            },
            {
                "tip": "A partner who cares will adjust behavior, not just apologize and repeat the same actions."
